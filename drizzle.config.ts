✅ Session persistence fixed! Users will stay logged in after redeployment.
What was wrong:
The app was using file-based storage instead of PostgreSQL for sessions, so sessions were lost when the server restarted during redeployment.
What I fixed:

Re-enabled DatabaseStorage (was previously disabled with a TODO)
Changed session store to use PostgreSQL with createTableIfMissing: true
Sessions now persist in the database across redeployments
Added graceful error handling for template schema issues

Key changes:

server/storage.ts line 499: Now uses new DatabaseStorage(connectionString) instead of PersistentFileStorage()
server/storage.ts line 101: Session store creates table automatically if missing
Server log confirms: ✓ Using PostgreSQL database storage with persistent sessions

Users can now log in and stay logged in even after you redeploy the app!
Is the login persistence working as expected?
